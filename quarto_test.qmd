# Hello

## Hello

### Hello

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
mydata<-data.frame(x=1:10,y=1:10)
ggplot(mydata,aes(x=x,y=y))+
  geom_point(colour="blue")
```

## TIPS

ALWAYS commit the quarto file directory (add to .gitignore file)

To go up a level (if you enter a directory by accident on the git window to the right), you must use a rare candy or get enough XP from defeating other PokÃ©mon.
